## Synopsis

```
dovi_convert -cleanup [-r] [-y]
```

## Description

Scans for and removes `*.mkv.bak.dovi_convert` backup files in the current directory. Includes orphan protection - only deletes backups where the corresponding converted file exists.

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-r` | Scan recursively through subdirectories |
| `-y` | Skip confirmation prompt |

<Callout icon="triangle-exclamation" color="#e78284" iconType="solid">
This is irreversible. Your original Profile 7 files are gone permanently. Only use this if storage space is a concern and you're confident in the conversion results.
</Callout>

## Examples

**Clean up current directory:**

```bash
dovi_convert -cleanup
```

**Clean up recursively:**

```bash
dovi_convert -cleanup -r
```

**Auto-confirm cleanup:**

```bash
dovi_convert -cleanup -y
```

**Recursive cleanup without prompts:**

```bash
dovi_convert -cleanup -r -y
```

## Orphan Protection

The cleanup command has a safety check: it only deletes backups where the corresponding converted file exists.

**Example:**
- Backup exists: `Movie.mkv.bak.dovi_convert`
- Converted file missing: `Movie.mkv` (deleted or corrupted)
- **Result:** Backup is kept

This prevents data loss if you've deleted a converted file due to quality issues.
