## Synopsis

```
dovi_convert cleanup [options]
```

## Description

Scans for and removes `*.mkv.bak.dovi_convert` backup files in the current directory. Includes orphan protection — only deletes backups where the corresponding converted file exists.

## Options

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--recursive` | `-r` | Scan recursively through subdirectories |
| `--yes` | `-y` | Skip confirmation prompt |
| `--debug` | — | Generate `dovi_convert_debug.log` with detailed output |

This is irreversible. Your original Profile 7 files are gone permanently. Only use this if storage space is a concern and you're confident in the conversion results.
</Callout>

## Examples

**Clean up current directory:**

```bash
dovi_convert cleanup
```

**Clean up recursively:**

```bash
dovi_convert cleanup --recursive
dovi_convert cleanup -r
```

**Auto-confirm cleanup:**

```bash
dovi_convert cleanup --yes
dovi_convert cleanup -y
```

**Recursive cleanup without prompts:**

```bash
dovi_convert cleanup --recursive --yes
dovi_convert cleanup -r -y
```

## Orphan Protection

The cleanup command has a safety check: it only deletes backups where the corresponding converted file exists.

**Example:**
- Backup exists: `movie.mkv.bak.dovi_convert`
- Converted file missing: `movie.mkv` (deleted or corrupted)
- **Result:** Backup is kept

This prevents data loss if you've deleted a converted file due to quality issues.
