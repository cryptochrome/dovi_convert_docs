## Synopsis

```
dovi_convert -batch [dir] [-r depth] [options]
```

## Description

Scans directories for Profile 7 files, analyzes their FEL complexity, and batch-converts safe candidates. The command first scans all files, shows a summary, then asks for confirmation before converting.

## Arguments

| Argument | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `[dir]` | path | current directory | Directory to scan. Multiple directories supported |
| `-r [depth]` | number | 1 (or 5 if just `-r`) | Recursion depth for subdirectories |

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-o PATH` | Output directory for converted files. Directory structure is preserved |
| `-temp PATH` | Write temporary files to a separate directory (improves speed on HDDs/NAS) |
| `-y` | Skip confirmation prompts (auto-confirm batch start) |
| `-include-simple` | Include Simple FEL files in auto-mode (requires `-y`) |
| `-force` | Force conversion on Complex FEL files |
| `-delete` | Delete backup files after successful conversions |
| `-safe` | Force Safe Mode for all conversions |
| `-debug` | Generate debug logs for all conversions |

## Safety Behavior

| File Type | Default Behavior |
|-----------|------------------|
| **MEL** | Converted automatically |
| **Simple FEL** | Pauses for confirmation |
| **Complex FEL** | Skipped entirely |

## Examples

**Batch convert current directory:**

```bash
dovi_convert -batch
```

**Target a specific directory:**

```bash
dovi_convert -batch /path/to/movies
```

**Multiple directories:**

```bash
dovi_convert -batch /movies /tv
```

**Scan 3 levels deep:**

```bash
dovi_convert -batch -r 3
```

**Directory with recursion:**

```bash
dovi_convert -batch /movies -r 3
```

**Fully automated (MEL only):**

```bash
dovi_convert -batch -y
```

**Fully automated (include Simple FEL):**

```bash
dovi_convert -batch -y -include-simple
```

<Callout icon="lightbulb" color="#a6d189" iconType="solid">
The `-y` flag skips the "Start batch?" prompt but still pauses on Simple FEL files unless you also use `-include-simple`.
</Callout>

**Force convert Complex FEL files:**

```bash
dovi_convert -batch -force
```

<Callout icon="circle-exclamation" color="#ef9f76" iconType="solid">
Forcing conversion on Complex FEL files produces incorrect results. Use this only if you understand and accept that some files will have incorrect tone mapping.
</Callout>

**Delete backups immediately:**

```bash
dovi_convert -batch -y -delete
```

<Callout icon="triangle-exclamation" color="#e78284" iconType="solid">
This is irreversible. Your original Profile 7 files are gone permanently. Only use this if storage space is a concern and you're confident in the conversion results.
</Callout>

**Use a fast temp directory (for HDDs/NAS):**

```bash
dovi_convert -batch -temp /mnt/ssd/temp
```

**Save converted files to a different directory:**

```bash
dovi_convert -batch /movies -o /output/converted
```

The output directory mirrors the source structure. For example, if you run:

```bash
dovi_convert -batch /movies/action -o /output
```

Files from `/movies/action/subdir/` end up in `/output/action/subdir/`. The directory name "action" is preserved, following the same convention as `cp` and `rsync`.

## Batch Summary

After scanning, dovi_convert shows a summary:

```
=== Batch Summary ===
Profile 7 MEL:        12 files
Profile 7 Simple FEL:  3 files
Profile 7 Complex FEL: 1 file (will be skipped)
Other/Ignored:        45 files

Total to convert: 15 files (423 GB)
Proceed? [y/N]
```
