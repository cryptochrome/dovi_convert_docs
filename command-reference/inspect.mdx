## Synopsis

```
dovi_convert -inspect <file> [-safe]
```

## Description

Performs a definitive frame-by-frame analysis of the entire file to verify whether the Enhancement Layer contains active brightness expansion. Use this to verify Simple FEL verdicts from `-scan`, or when you need absolute certainty before conversion.

## Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `<file>` | Yes | Path to the MKV file to inspect |

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-safe` | Force Safe Mode (disk extraction). Extracts video stream to disk before analyzing |

<Callout icon="circle-exclamation" color="#ef9f76" iconType="solid">
`-inspect` reads the entire file frame-by-frame. For a typical 50-80 GB movie, this takes several minutes. It's not suitable for batch operations.
</Callout>

## Examples

**Inspect a file:**

```bash
dovi_convert -inspect "Movie.mkv"
```

**Inspect with Safe Mode:**

```bash
dovi_convert -inspect "Movie.mkv" -safe
```

## Output

After analysis, `-inspect` reports:

- Whether **brightness expansion** was detected
- The **peak brightness** values found in the metadata
- **FEL verdict** - Simple FEL (safe) or Complex FEL (skip)
