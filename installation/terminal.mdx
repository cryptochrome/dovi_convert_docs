This page should contain detailed installation instructions for dovi_convert, but only for the non-docker version. The page should contain:

1. The OSes we support (macOS, Linux, and Windows with WSL)
2. The dependencies
3. Install instructions for stable version
4. Install instructions "from source" (e. g. via git pull)

Use the dovi_script repo's [README.md](http://README.md) as a reference. 

Be verbose enough but don't write a novel, be friendly and mindful of users who aren't familiar with the CLI, but don't make powerusers angry with too much info.

MAke use of codeblocks and other Mintlify features to make the page look beautiful.

At the end, point users to reading the core concepts section to get started.
