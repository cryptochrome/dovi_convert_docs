This page should talk a bit our docker container, its features (like the web terminal) and then explain installation with the normal docker run command, as well as a separate section for Docker Compose (example file is in the dovi_convert repo, use it). 

Make sure you explain the PUID and PGID environment variables. 

Also explain the other config options like the bind-mount and the web server port.

Use code blocks. Use mintlify features to make the page look beautiful.
