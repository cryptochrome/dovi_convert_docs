The dovi_convert Docker container provides a self-contained environment with all dependencies pre-installed. It includes a web-based terminal, so you can access the tool from any browser without installing anything on your host system.

## Features

- **Web terminal** - Access dovi_convert through your browser at `http://your-host:7681`
- **Pre-configured environment** - All dependencies (ffmpeg, dovi_tool, mkvtoolnix, mediainfo) included
- **NAS-friendly** - Designed for network storage devices and servers
- **User mapping** - Run with your own UID/GID to avoid file permission issues

## Quick start

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Docker run">
    ```bash
    docker run -d \
      --name=dovi_convert \
      -e PUID=1000 \
      -e PGID=1000 \
      -e TZ=Europe/Berlin \
      -p 7681:7681 \
      -v /path/to/media:/data \
      --restart unless-stopped \
      cryptochrome/dovi_convert:latest
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Docker Compose">
    Save this as `docker-compose.yml`:

    ```yaml
    services:
      dovi_convert:
        image: cryptochrome/dovi_convert:latest
        container_name: dovi_convert
        hostname: dovi-convert
        environment:
          - PUID=1000  # Your user ID (run 'id' to find)
          - PGID=1000  # Your group ID
          - TZ=Europe/Berlin  # Your timezone
        volumes:
          # Mount your media folder(s) here
          - /mnt/media/movies:/data/movies
          - /mnt/media/tv:/data/tv
        ports:
          - 7681:7681
        restart: unless-stopped
    ```

    Then start the container:

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Then open `http://your-docker-host:7681` in your browser.

## Configuration

### User and group IDs

The `PUID` and `PGID` environment variables control which user the container runs as. Set these to match your host user to avoid permission problems when accessing files.

To find your user and group IDs:

```bash
id
```

This outputs something like `uid=1000(yourname) gid=1000(yourname)`. Use these values for `PUID` and `PGID`.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PUID` | 1000 | User ID for file permissions |
| `PGID` | 1000 | Group ID for file permissions |
| `TZ` | `Europe/Berlin` | Timezone for log timestamps |

### Volume mounts

Mount your media directories to `/data` inside the container. You can mount multiple paths:

```bash
-v /mnt/movies:/data/movies \
-v /mnt/tv:/data/tv
```

Inside the container, access your files at `/data/movies`, `/data/tv`, etc.

### Port configuration

The web terminal runs on port 7681 inside the container. Map it to any available port on your host:

```bash
-p 8080:7681  # Access at http://your-host:8080
```

## Using the web terminal

Once the container is running, open `http://your-docker-host:7681` in your browser. You'll see a terminal session with dovi_convert ready to use.

The container includes a `dovi` alias for convenience:

```bash
dovi -help         # Same as dovi_convert -help
dovi -scan         # Scan all files in current directory
```

<Accordion title="Notes (for internal use)">
This page should talk a bit our docker container, its features (like the web terminal) and then explain installation with the normal docker run command, as well as a separate section for Docker Compose (example file is in the dovi_convert repo, use it). 

Make sure you explain the PUID and PGID environment variables. 

Also explain the other config options like the bind-mount and the web server port.

Use code blocks. Use mintlify features to make the page look beautiful.
