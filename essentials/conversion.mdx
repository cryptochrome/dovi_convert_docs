This page will explain in detail how to use the -convert feature. 

Sections:

1. How convert works (what it does), including "safety first" (e. g. non-destructive, backing up originals, etc.)
2. How to use it, with concrete usage examples, covering all command options (like -safe. -force, -delete, etc.). Be verbose, userfriendly, mindful of users not too familiar with the CLI, and use codeblocks and other mintlify features to make it look beautiful. Don't cram all usage examples into the same codeblock, discuss every option with it's own codeblock, give warnings for potentially unsafe options (like -delete and -force) and explain why they might be unsafe. 
3. The page should really be extensive and the usage examples should be grouped into sections
