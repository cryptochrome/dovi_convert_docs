The `-convert` command converts a single Dolby Vision Profile 7 file to Profile 8.1. The process strips the Enhancement Layer, injects the dynamic metadata (RPU) into the Base Layer, and produces a file compatible with most Dolby Vision devices.

## How conversion works

The conversion process:

1. **Extracts** the video stream from your MKV file
2. **Strips** the Enhancement Layer (EL)
3. **Injects** the RPU metadata into the Base Layer
4. **Remuxes** everything back into a new MKV file

<Info>
  No video re-encoding happens. The bitstream is processed directly, so conversion is fast and quality is preserved exactly.
</Info>

## Safety features

dovi_convert is designed to be non-destructive:

- **Automatic backup** - Your original file is renamed to `*.bak.dovi_convert` before any changes
- **Scan before convert** - Each file is analyzed to detect Complex FEL
- **Safe defaults** - Complex FEL files are skipped unless you explicitly override

All audio and subtitle tracks are preserved in the converted file.

## Basic usage

Convert a single file:

```bash
dovi_convert -convert "Movie.mkv"
```

The command:

1. Analyzes the file for FEL complexity
2. Creates a backup (`Movie.mkv.bak.dovi_convert`)
3. Converts to Profile 8.1
4. Replaces the original with the converted file

## Conversion modes

dovi_convert has two processing modes:

### Standard mode (default)

Pipes video data directly between ffmpeg and dovi_tool. Fast and efficient - requires no temporary disk space for the video stream.

```bash
dovi_convert -convert "Movie.mkv"
```

### Safe mode

Extracts the video stream to disk first, then processes it. Slower, but handles files that Standard mode can't process.

```bash
dovi_convert -convert "Movie.mkv" -safe
```

<Info>
  If Standard mode fails (common with Seamless Branching or irregular file structures), Safe mode is triggered automatically. You don't need to manually retry.
</Info>

## Command options

### Force conversion (`-force`)

Override safety checks and convert Complex FEL files:

```bash
dovi_convert -convert "Movie.mkv" -force
```

<Info>
  Forcing conversion on Complex FEL files produces incorrect tone mapping. The picture may appear dark, have flickering, or show other artifacts. Only use this if you understand and accept the quality loss.
</Info>

### Delete backup (`-delete`)

Automatically delete the backup file after successful conversion:

```bash
dovi_convert -convert "Movie.mkv" -delete
```

<Info>
  This removes your only copy of the original Profile 7 file. Use with caution - if something goes wrong or you later want to restore the original, you can't.
</Info>

### Debug mode (`-debug`)

Generate a detailed log file for troubleshooting:

```bash
dovi_convert -convert "Movie.mkv" -debug
```

This creates `dovi_convert_debug.log` in the current directory, containing output from all internal tools (ffmpeg, dovi_tool, mkvmerge).

## Handling Simple FEL files

When converting a Simple FEL file, dovi_convert prompts for confirmation:

```
Simple FEL detected. This file likely converts safely, but verify with -inspect if uncertain.
Continue? [y/N]
```

This is a precaution - Simple FEL files usually convert correctly, but the scan might have missed isolated brightness spikes. If you want certainty, run `-inspect` first.

## What happens to your files

| Before                  | After                                          |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `Movie.mkv` (Profile 7) | `Movie.mkv` (Profile 8.1)                      |
| -                       | `Movie.mkv.bak.dovi_convert` (original backup) |

The backup contains your complete original file. You can restore it by:

```bash
mv "Movie.mkv.bak.dovi_convert" "Movie.mkv"
```

## Troubleshooting

If conversion fails:

1. Run with `-debug` to generate a log:

   ```bash
   dovi_convert -convert "Movie.mkv" -debug
   ```
2. Check `dovi_convert_debug.log` for errors from ffmpeg, dovi_tool, or mkvmerge
3. Common issues:
   - **Seamless Branching** - Try with `-safe` mode
   - **Corrupted files** - Verify the original file plays correctly
   - **Disk space** - Safe mode needs space for the extracted video stream
