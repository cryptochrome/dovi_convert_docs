dovi_convert creates space-efficient `.dovi` archives that allow you to restore your original Profile 7 files bit-for-bit, even after converting them to Profile 8.1 or HDR10.

## Why Use Archives?

A full backup of a 60 GB movie takes another 60 GB. A `.dovi` archive is significantly smaller because it stores only the essential Dolby Vision data:

1. **Enhancement Layer (EL)** — The track containing the difference between the base layer and the full 12-bit signal
2. **RPU Metadata** — The dynamic brightness information

**Typical savings:**
- **MEL (Minimal Enhancement Layer):** Extremely small (~200 MB - 1 GB)
- **FEL (Full Enhancement Layer):** Larger, typically **10-25%** of the original file size (e.g., 6-15 GB for a 60 GB movie)


This allows you to keep bit-exact backups of your entire library without doubling your storage requirements.

## Creating a Backup

You can create a backup snapshot either before conversion or while converting.

### Standalone Backup

Create a snapshot without modifying the video file:

```bash
dovi_convert backup movie.mkv
```

This creates `movie.dovi` in the same directory.

### Backup During Conversion

Create a backup automatically when you convert to Profile 8.1:

```bash
dovi_convert convert movie.mkv --backup
```

Or when stripping Dolby Vision to clean HDR10:

```bash
dovi_convert convert movie.mkv --hdr10 --backup
```

## Restoring Files

Restoration is a "purist" process. It ensures the output is identical to the original source, regardless of whether your current file is Profile 8.1 (with injected RPU) or plain HDR10.

To restore a file:

```bash
dovi_convert restore movie.mkv
```

The tool will:
1. Locate `movie.dovi`
2. Extract the Base Layer from your video
3. Sanitize it (remove any injected RPU if present)
4. Mux it with the original Enhancement Layer from the archive
5. Remux everything with your audio and subtitle tracks

### Restoring from a Different Location

If you moved your `.dovi` archive to a backup drive, point to it explicitly:

```bash
dovi_convert restore movie.mkv --source /Volumes/Backups/movie.dovi
```

**Bit-exact restoration**: The process separates metadata from video essence to guarantee the restored file is identical to the source.
