This feature is coming in a future version of dovi_convert. The information below describes planned functionality.
</Callout>

The Backup & Restore feature lets you archive the original Dolby Vision layers before conversion, enabling bit-perfect restoration later.

## Why back up?

When you convert Profile 7 to Profile 8.1, the Enhancement Layer is discarded. If you later acquire a device that supports Profile 7 FEL (like the Ugoos AM6B+), you'd need the original file to take advantage of it.

Standard backups mean keeping the entire original file - often 50-80GB per movie. With Backup & Restore, you archive only the Enhancement Layer and RPU metadata, typically saving 90% of the space.

| Approach | Storage per movie |
|----------|-------------------|
| Keep full original | ~80 GB |
| Backup EL + RPU only | ~8 GB |

## How it will work

### Creating backups

Before conversion, archive the Enhancement Layer:

```bash
dovi_convert -backup "Movie.mkv"
```

This creates a `.dovi` archive file containing:
- The Enhancement Layer (EL)
- The RPU metadata
- Checksums for verification

### Restoring originals

Recombine a converted file with its backup:

```bash
dovi_convert -restore "Movie.mkv"
```

The restore command:
1. Locates the corresponding `.dovi` archive
2. Recombines the Enhancement Layer with the Base Layer
3. Produces a bit-exact copy of the original Profile 7 file

## Current alternative

Until this feature is available, you can:

1. Keep your original Profile 7 files as `.bak.dovi_convert` backups
2. Use external storage for files you might want to restore later
3. Re-rip from disc if you need the original again
