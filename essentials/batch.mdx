The `-batch` command processes multiple files at once. It scans a directory (or the current directory by default), identifies all Profile 7 files, and converts them in sequence. You can target specific directories and control recursion depth.

## How batch processing works

When you run `-batch`:

1. **Scans** the directory recursively for MKV files
2. **Analyzes** each file to identify Profile 7 content and FEL status
3. **Displays** a summary showing what will be converted
4. **Asks** for confirmation before proceeding
5. **Converts** eligible files one by one

Non-Profile 7 files are skipped automatically. You don't need to filter your directory first.
</Callout>

## Basic usage

Process all Profile 7 files in the current directory:

```bash
dovi_convert -batch
```

### Target specific directories

Point `-batch` at any directory instead of navigating there first:

```bash
dovi_convert -batch /path/to/movies
```

You can specify multiple directories in a single command:

```bash
dovi_convert -batch /movies /tv /documentaries
```

### Recursive scanning

By default, `-batch` only looks at the top level of each directory. Use `-r` to scan subdirectories:

```bash
dovi_convert -batch -r 2    # Scan 2 levels deep
dovi_convert -batch -r       # Default: 5 levels deep
```

Combine with directory targeting:

```bash
dovi_convert -batch /movies -r 3
```

## Safety behavior

Batch processing follows the same safety rules as single-file conversion:

| File type | Default behavior |
|-----------|------------------|
| **MEL** | Converted automatically |
| **Simple FEL** | Pauses for confirmation |
| **Complex FEL** | Skipped entirely |

### Handling Simple FEL files

By default, batch processing stops when it encounters Simple FEL files and asks if you want to include them:

```
Found 3 Simple FEL files. Include them in this batch? [y/N]
```

If you say no, the batch continues with only MEL files.

## Automation options

### Auto-confirm (`-y`)

Skip the initial confirmation prompt:

```bash
dovi_convert -batch -y
```

<Callout icon="circle-info" color="#8caaee" iconType="solid">
The `-y` flag skips the "Start batch?" prompt but still pauses on Simple FEL files. This prevents accidental processing of files you might want to verify first.
</Callout>

### Include Simple FEL (`-include-simple`)

Treat Simple FEL files the same as MEL - process them without pausing:

```bash
dovi_convert -batch -y -include-simple
```

This combination gives you fully automated processing:
- `-y` skips the start confirmation
- `-include-simple` skips the Simple FEL confirmation

### Force Complex FEL (`-force`)

Include Complex FEL files in the batch:

```bash
dovi_convert -batch -force
```

<Callout icon="circle-exclamation" color="#ef9f76" iconType="solid">
Forcing conversion on Complex FEL files produces incorrect results. Use this only if you understand and accept that some files will have incorrect tone mapping.
</Callout>

### Permanent deletion (`-delete`)

Remove original files immediately after each successful conversion, skipping the backup step entirely:

```bash
dovi_convert -batch -delete
```

<Callout icon="triangle-exclamation" color="#e78284" iconType="solid">
This is irreversible. Your original Profile 7 files are gone permanently. Only use this if storage space is a concern and you're confident in the conversion results.
</Callout>

<Callout icon="lightbulb" color="#a6d189" iconType="solid">
If storage is a concern but you want a safety net, run the batch without `-delete`, verify your results, then use `-cleanup` to remove backups selectively.
</Callout>

## Batch summary

After scanning, dovi_convert shows a summary:

```
=== Batch Summary ===
Profile 7 MEL:        12 files
Profile 7 Simple FEL:  3 files
Profile 7 Complex FEL: 1 file (will be skipped)
Other/Ignored:        45 files

Total to convert: 15 files (423 GB)
Proceed? [y/N]
```

This gives you a chance to review before any changes are made.

## Cleaning up backups

After batch processing, you will have `.bak.dovi_convert` backup files. These are the backups of your original files. If you don't want to keep them, you can remove them using the `-cleanup` command.

<Callout icon="triangle-exclamation" color="#e78284" iconType="solid">
This is irreversible. Your original Profile 7 files are gone permanently. Only use this if storage space is a concern and you're confident in the conversion results.
</Callout>

### Basic cleanup

Remove backup files in the current directory:

```bash
dovi_convert -cleanup
```

### Recursive cleanup

Remove backups from subdirectories:

```bash
dovi_convert -cleanup -r
```

### Auto-confirm cleanup

Skip the confirmation prompt:

```bash
dovi_convert -cleanup -y
```

<Callout icon="circle-info" color="#8caaee" iconType="solid">
The cleanup command has a safety check: it only deletes backups where the corresponding converted file exists. If you deleted the converted file (maybe it was corrupted), the backup is kept as orphan protection.
</Callout>
