title: "Introduction"
description: "Homepage of the dovi_convert documentation"
---

- we should have a nice welcome page that explains what dovi_convert does
  - basically the top part of the dovi_convert repo [README.md](http://README.md)
  - but a bit more verbose and user-friendly
- Another section below the intro should contain details like where the script runs on (OSes, Docker), basic requirements, a hint that nothing is re-encoded (no beefy hardware required)
- Then we should use some nice cards (mintlify) or other mintlify deocative objects that lead into the What you should know page, and the installation page. Point out that the "what you should know" page contains important info and caveats. 
- Have an important section that asks users to understand the core concepts (conversion, scanning and analysis, batch processing, backup & restore) - use nice cards or other decorative elements that lead to those pages

So this whole page should serve as a welcome page and a home page for the entire dovi_convert project.
