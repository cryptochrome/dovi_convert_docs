description: "Convert Dolby Vision Profile 7 to Profile 8.1 safely and automatically"
---

dovi_convert automates the conversion of Dolby Vision Profile 7 MKV files (typically UHD Blu-ray rips) into Profile 8.1. This ensures compatibility with media players that don't support the Profile 7 Enhancement Layer.

## Why Convert?

Many popular devices — including Apple TV 4K, Nvidia Shield, Zidoo players, and Plex clients — cannot process the Enhancement Layer in Profile 7 files. Without proper handling, these devices fall back to HDR10, losing Dolby Vision benefits entirely.

Converting to Profile 8.1 strips the Enhancement Layer while preserving the dynamic metadata (RPU), giving you a file that works on virtually any Dolby Vision-capable device.

Not every Profile 7 file should be converted. Some use the Enhancement Layer for brightness expansion — converting these causes visual issues. dovi_convert analyzes files before conversion and warns you when conversion is risky.

## Platform Support

dovi_convert runs on:

- **macOS** (tested on macOS 26)
- **Linux** (any modern distribution)
- **Windows** (via WSL)
- **Docker** (with web terminal access)

The conversion process does not re-encode video. Your CPU only needs to handle metadata extraction and remuxing — no powerful hardware required.
