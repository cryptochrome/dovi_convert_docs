description: "Convert Dolby Vision Profile 7 to Profile 8.1 safely and automatically"
---

dovi_convert automates the conversion of Dolby Vision Profile 7 MKV files (typically UHD Blu-ray rips) into Profile 8.1. This ensures compatibility with media players that don't support the Profile 7 Enhancement Layer.

## Why convert?

Many popular devices—including Apple TV 4K, Nvidia Shield, Zidoo players, and Plex clients—cannot process the Enhancement Layer in Profile 7 files. Without proper handling, these devices fall back to HDR10, losing Dolby Vision benefits entirely.

Converting to Profile 8.1 strips the Enhancement Layer while preserving the dynamic metadata (RPU), giving you a file that works on virtually any Dolby Vision-capable device.

<Warning>
Not every Profile 7 file should be converted. Some use the Enhancement Layer for brightness expansion—converting these causes visual issues. dovi_convert analyzes files before conversion and warns you when conversion is risky.

## What you need to know

Before using dovi_convert, you should understand what it does and when conversion is appropriate.

  <Card title="Before You Start" icon="circle-info" href="/before-you-start">
    Understand the technical background, caveats, and device-specific considerations
  </Card>
  <Card title="FEL Types Explained" icon="layer-group" href="/before-you-start#understanding-the-enhancement-layer">

## Platform support

dovi_convert runs on:

- **macOS** (tested on macOS 26)
- **Linux** (any modern distribution)
- **Windows** (via WSL)
- **Docker** (with web terminal access)

<Tip>
The conversion process does not re-encode video. Your CPU only needs to handle metadata extraction and remuxing—no powerful hardware required.

## Core concepts

Once installed, familiarize yourself with the main features:

  <Card title="Batch Processing" icon="files" href="/essentials/batch">
    Scan and convert entire directories with `-batch`

<Accordion title="Notes (for internal use)">
- we should have a nice welcome page that explains what dovi_convert does
  - basically the top part of the dovi_convert repo README.md
  - but a bit more verbose and user-friendly
- Another section below the intro should contain details like where the script runs on (OSes, Docker), basic requirements, a hint that nothing is re-encoded (no beefy hardware required)
- Then we should use some nice cards (mintlify) or other mintlify deocative objects that lead into the What you should know page, and the installation page. Point out that the "what you should know" page contains important info and caveats.
- Have an important section that asks users to understand the core concepts (conversion, scanning and analysis, batch processing, backup & restore) - use nice cards or other decorative elements that lead to those pages

So this whole page should serve as a welcome page and a home page for the entire dovi_convert project.
