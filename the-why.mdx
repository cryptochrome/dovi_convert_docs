title: "What you should know"
description: "Why does dovi_convert exist, and what you should know"
---

This page should cover important topics and caveats, mimicing what we have in the dovi_convert repo README.md, but more verbose and friendly. 

Structure could be:

1. The Problem (they why, many players don't support dovi profile 7, fall back to HDR, Shield converts blindly, Kodi too (when Dovi compatiibility mode is active), etc. - So basically, why it makes sense to convert to 8.1
2. Explain the FEL details we have in the README.md, without going into the technical details on how our tool inspects and scans. Just the "good to know about FEL" stuff, the caveats and why not every Dovi 7 video should be converted (and that our tool handles it - point to the File Scanning and Analysis page)
3. Have some explicit notes about the nvidia shield, as well as plex on appletv (same as in the README.md, but nicer, friendlier, more verbose, and fact checked)
4. Anything else that comes to mind?

Make sure the page has a nice design, making extensive use of Mintlify's features
